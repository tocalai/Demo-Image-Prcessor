# Demo image processing

**Demo 1-1**
  * Drawing one-dimensional grating
  * Brightness of grating changed from 0-255 along with X-axis

**Demo 1-2**
  * Drawing two-dimensional grating
  * Brightness of grating changed from 0-255 along with X-axis and Y-axis (with Cosine wave)

**Demo 2-1**
  * Detect the noise pixel by pixel, using the average brightness of surrounding pixel(top, down, left, right) to determine the noise
  * Using the avergae brightness to replace the original(target) brightness if the target considerate as noise

**Demo 2-2**
  * Detect the noise pixel by pixel, using the average brightness of surrounding pixel(top, down, left, right, topOfLeft, topOfRight, downOfLeft, downOfRight, itself) to determine the noise
  * Using the avergae brightness(exclude the most two higher and lower pixel) to replace the original(target) brightness if the target considerate as noise
